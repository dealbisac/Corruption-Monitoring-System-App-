# Flutter Khalti Clone (WIP)
A flutter app cloning Khalti Apps UI interactions.

## Expandable Bottom App Bar
Implementing the expandable bottom app bar was a challenge, and luckily I found [this](https://github.com/rIIh/expandable-bottom-bar) repository. I just had to make few modifications to make it look and work near about as implemented in original Khalti app.

## Home page
Home page had multiple grids, floating app bar and different items, so I had to use `CustomScrollView` with `Slivers` to get the required output.

## Implemented Screens
